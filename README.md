> For the moment Infram-Bot only works in window...

1. Download/Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/kbiters/infram```.

3. Open a console or terminal in the bot folder.

4. Create a virtual environment: ```py -m venv env``` or ```python -m venv env```.
 
5. Activate the virtual environment: ```envScriptsactivate.bat```.

6. Install the necessary requirements: ```pip install -r req-infram.txt```.

7. Once finished downloading the necessary libraries, run the app.py: ```py app.py``` or ```python app.py``` and that's it! you will have the bot running!

> In case you want to create an executable file, open the cmd in the "Infram" directory, copy the content of the file "CREATION OF EXEs.txt" and paste it in the cmd you previously executed.
